In the Milky Way alone there might be as many 100 billion Earth-like planets. If Betelgeuse would explode transiting from the red super giant stage to supernova then our sky would light continuously for two months.

When helium is just a few degrees below its boiling point of –452 degrees Fahrenheit (–269 degrees Celsius) it will suddenly be able to do things that other fluids can’t, like dribble through molecule-thin cracks climb up and over the sides of a dish and remain motionless when its container is spun. No longer a mere liquid, the helium has become a superfluid—a liquid that flows without friction. If you set [down] a cup with a liquid circulating around and you come back 10 minutes later, of course it’s stopped moving says John Beamish an experimental ..';
