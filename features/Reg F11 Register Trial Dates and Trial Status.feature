  Scenario Outline: #1 Trial Status Transition Rules for Status Zero
    Given I have selected the option to register a trial <trialType>
    And I am on the Register Trial Status screen
    When I add a trial status from <statusFrom> to trial status <statusTo> along with why study stopped reason <whyStudyStopped> and same day rule <Sameday> the respective checks <errorsWarnings> will be there

 Scenario Outline: #8 Rules for Study Date types
    Given I have selected the option to register a trial <trialType>
    And I am on the Trial Dates Screen
    When the Trial date is in the past
    Then the Trial date type must be actual
    When  the Trial date is today
    Then the Trial Date type could be actual
    And the Trial date Type could be anticipated
    When the Trial date is in the future
    Then the Trial date type must always be anticipated

    Examples:
      |trialType  |
      |National                 |
      |Externally Peer-Reviewed |
      |Institutional            |
