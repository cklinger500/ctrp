Feature: Reg F13 Register Trial Documents

As a CTRP User, I can attach various documents to a trial registration

Scenario Outline: #1 I can attach Trial Related Documents to a trial registration
Given I have selected the option to register a trial <TrialType>
And I am on the Register Trial Related Documents screen
And I have noted the message 
     """
     To ensure successful registration, upload a Protocol document and an IRB Approval document. If the Protocol document does not include the Informed Consent and/or participating sites, upload the Informed Consent document and a list of participating sites separately. You can use the Participating Sites template to submit your list of participating sites.
     CTRP accepts most standard document types. For additional information about what document types are accepted, please refer to the Help section.
